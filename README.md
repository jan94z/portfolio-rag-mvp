# Retrieval Augmented Generation Portfolio Project
Status: *Work in progress*

This project is a hands-on exercise in GenAI engineering. Its aim is to cover:
* REST API endpoints via FastAPI (optionally with authentication)
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline
* Integration of a vector database for document retrieval
* Embedding generation and storage
* Querying large language models (LLMs) via API (OpenAI, later self-hosted models)
* Containerization with Docker
* Kubernetes deployment readiness
* Automated CI/CD using GitHub Actions
* Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) using Terraform
* Basic monitoring and logging (Prometheus, Grafana)

The main goal is to demonstrate the design and implementation of a modern, production-oriented GenAI backend as a portfolio showcase.
The codebase is structured for easy extension, experimentation, and migration to self-hosted LLMs and cloud-native infrastructure.
